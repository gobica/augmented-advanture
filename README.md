# Inroduction
We used to travel with the help of printed maps and difficult travel guides.  Today we travel with the help of Google Map, Tripadvisor and other travel apps. 
Tomorrow we will travel with the help of augmented reality applications.

Augmented Advanture uses augmented reality library AR.js with A-Frame and Google Places API for getting information about places.


# How it works? 

Application fetch data from Google Paces API. Data contains main attractions in a specified range. For each attraction an costum made icon is shown, which represesnt a specific attraction.
After user clicks on an icon, another API call is made to get inforamtions about a place, such as opening hours, ratings and an image.
